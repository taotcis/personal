I. Introduction
This document provides the definitive chronological account of all documented activity, situations, and events involving the physical body of Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB), the Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM), the Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM), and John Robison. It meticulously spans from their initial contact in September 2020 to April 21, 2025, and comprehensively includes meetings, periods of cohabitation, and the detailed context of the Nightfalls operation. This chronology endeavors to capture the intricate interplay between these individuals and the complex influences exerted upon them within the overarching narrative of The American Genocide (TAG).
II. Detailed Chronological Sections

   * You undertook a visit to Robison's residence.
   * Engaged in social activities involving Tina and GHB, resulting in an episode of "swirling out," characterized by a loss of consciousness attributed to excessive GHB consumption.

   * This initial hookup scenario was orchestrated within the framework of the Campaign to Suffocate Spark (CSS) and executed by the PDSM.
   * Robison employed psychological manipulation techniques, specifically "love bombing" (overwhelming with affection and attention) and "love idealization" (presenting an idealized and perfect image), directed at the PDSM.
B. First Cohabitation (Fall 2020)
 * PDSM's behavioral patterns, notably driven by an intense desire for Tina, precipitated your eviction from the residence of Avery and Kiersa Ceo.
 * Subsequent to this displacement, you relocated to Robison's residence, initiating contact from the library in Doraville.
 * Your cohabitation with Robison extended through the Thanksgiving period of 2020.
C. Intervening Period
 * (Detailed documentation of your activities and locations during the interim period between the first and second instances of cohabitation with Robison can be incorporated here, contingent upon the availability of specific information.)
D. Second Cohabitation (Fall 2021 - February 2022)
 * Fall 2021 - February 2022: You re-established a connection with Robison.
   * Initially, you resided on Robison's couch, subsequently transitioning to KO's former room.
   * KO and EJ were present in the household; however, KO was later evicted following a staged altercation with Robison.
   * PDSM's influence became increasingly dominant, marked by opposition and sabotage directed towards you.
   * Tina was strategically utilized as a reward mechanism to incentivize PDSM's compliance with directives from the Company.
   * Individuals impersonating Company operatives presented themselves as former clients, coworkers, and friends to furnish you with employment opportunities.
 * Events during the second cohabitation period with Robison:
   * Robison engaged in direct communication with the PDSM.
   * PDSM perpetrated severe acts of self-harm, including damaging the KEWB with scissors and inflicting repeated stab wounds to the groin area, necessitating restorative intervention by the Creator.
   * You experienced a near-complete deprivation of the functional use of your penis.
   * You encountered Ishmael Buckner at a social gathering, during which you achieved an erection despite a lack of attraction towards him.
   * You awoke to find KO performing oral sex, revealing a communication link between KO and PDSM.
   * At least two individuals with affiliations to Gilead Sciences and the Company engaged in sexual encounters with you for the explicit purpose of measuring the form of the penis on KEWB.
   * You experienced an inability to attain an erection with the only two individuals towards whom you were romantically attracted.
 * October 2021: Robison extended an offer for you to reside in a rent-free room at his residence.
   * Robison represented himself as a computing professional.
   * The Creator's revelations in early 2025 disclosed Robison's identity as a CIA operative.
   * Unbeknownst to you, Robison was actively manipulating PDSM to cultivate destructive behaviors deemed necessary for the execution of "Jacobsen's Ladder."
 * October 21, 2021: You and Robison were involved in a car accident.
   * The accident presented circumstances indicative of a potentially fatal outcome, yet it resulted only in billowing smoke emanating from under the hood.
   * The smoke resulting from this accident is visually depicted in the opening scene of the music video for "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" by Vandaveer.
 * The Creator's communication indicates that towards the conclusion of your cohabitation with Robison, PDSM conveyed an inability to fulfill the Company's demands, an event shortly followed by the "rip cord incident."
 * The "Rip Cord Incident":
   * The incident commenced in the morning with your encounter with an unidentified male individual in the kitchen area.
   * Subsequently, Robison alleged that this individual had robbed him and forcibly inserted a toilet scrub brush handle into his rectum.
   * You declined to remove the object due to concerns regarding potential internal injuries and advocated for contacting emergency medical services (911).
   * Rafael arrived at the scene and claimed to have resolved the situation within a brief timeframe.
   * Ken Mabry, who had departed prior to Rafael's arrival, discovered the broken head of the toilet brush in the trash, casting doubt upon Robison's account.
 * Following a period of several months, Robison issued a demand for rent without prior notice and subsequently evicted you from his residence.
   * He placed a portion of your clothing (intermixed with that of an unidentified individual) on the porch and retained possession of some of your belongings.
 * Additional details pertaining to Robison:
   * You observed Robison and KO engaged in processing paperwork that bore a resemblance to medical billing documents.
   * You encountered Robison on a MARTA train, accompanied by friends and a teenage son, subsequent to your departure from his residence.

 * February 2025: You were contacted by Robison via NKP, a social networking and hookup site catering to gay men.
   * You arranged a meeting with Robison; he made a stop to visit his dealer, and you subsequently proceeded to his residence in Lilburn, which was in a state of disarray.
   * Robison requested your assistance in administering Tina via intravenous injection; when you were unable to provide this assistance, he provided you with a gram of Tina and transported you to the nearest train station.
   * The request for assistance with Tina administration was a deceptive tactic; an exchange of communication occurred between PDSM and Robison while you were rendered unconscious.
   * Robison engaged in foreplay with PDSM (devoid of any physical contact) to manipulate PDSM into reducing the form of KEWB for the Litmus Test, an assessment designed to gauge the Creator's potential intervention in TAG orchestrations.
 * Subsequent encounters with Robison between February and March 2025:
   * Robison offered Tina with a generous demeanor, often without an immediate expectation of payment.
